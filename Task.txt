Task
The Museum visitor system registered all the visits, entrance and leaving times with one
minute precision. This way system collected N value pairs, where first one indicates the
time of entrance and second one time of leaving. Please find the time interval, when
there was the greatest number of visitors in the museum. The entrance and leaving time
are included. For example, if one visitor arrived at 10:30 and another one leaved at
10:30 then there were two visitors in museum on that time.
Expected solution:
1. Develop the program, that:
a. Reads the times for input file. The file location is given as first command line
parameter. The input file is text file where every line has one entrance- and
leaving time. Example 10:15,14:20 The times can occur in random order
inside file. You can use included file ‘Visits.txt’ for testing.
b. Finds the time interval when there were greatest number of visitors inside
museum. If there are multiple periods with same number, all these need to be
found.
c. Displays the results found in previous point in format <begin time>-<end
time>;<Number of visitors>. Example: 11:12-13:20;6
d. For example, for input
10:00,10:30
10:10,10:40
10:20,10:50
the expected output is:
10:20-10:30;3
